# Personal-Finance-Tracker
My project is a personal finance tracker and budgeting web application designed to help users monitor spending habits, categorize expenses, and visualize financial progress. Many users underestimate daily expenses or avoid tracking finances due to overly complex or expensive tools. This app provides a simple, user-friendly dashboard to make financial awareness accessible.
Target users include college students, young professionals, and anyone aiming to improve financial habits or save for specific goals.
Core features:
Expense Tracking and Categorization – log or import transactions, automatically categorized using smart rules.


Budget Creation and Monitoring – set budgets per category and receive alerts when nearing limits.


Data Visualization Dashboard – interactive charts showing spending trends, category breakdowns, and savings progress.


Goal Tracking – set savings goals and monitor progress over time.


Technology stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for full-stack JS development. React provides a dynamic UI, Node/Express manage APIs, and MongoDB handles user-specific financial data.
AI integration strategy: Use machine learning rules to categorize transactions automatically and suggest budget optimizations.
